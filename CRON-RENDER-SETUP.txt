GitHub Actions cron (Option A) – one thing to do on Render:

1. Open Render Dashboard → your Web Service (job-scheduler-api).
2. Environment → Add variable:
   Key:   CRON_SECRET
   Value: (same as your GitHub secret, e.g. Abhi@123)
3. Save. Render will redeploy.

After that, the workflow runs every 5 min and jobs will execute on the live site.
